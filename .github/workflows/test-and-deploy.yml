To set up your project on GitHub so that it hosts the page and ensures code quality via automated tests, youâ€™ll need to create a few additional files and configurations. Below are the necessary files to add to your project:
To achieve your requirements of hosting the project on GitHub Pages and ensuring that tests are run when changes are pushed, I'll provide the necessary files and configurations:

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: This will automatically run tests on every push to the repository.
2. **Jest for Testing**: I'll set up Jest as the testing framework for your JavaScript code.
3. **GitHub Pages Deployment**: This will automatically deploy the project to GitHub Pages after the tests pass.
